# LaTeXinstaller
Small automated script to install quickly a basic LaTeX package structure on Linux Debian based distribution.

Note that some basic feature are set as default:
- paper = a4, default plain vertical common paper
- scheme = scheme-basic, default LaTeX basic scheme (reference <https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlpsrc/scheme-basic.tlpsrc?view=markup>)

## Disclaimer

_Have nice LaTeX typesetting!_
